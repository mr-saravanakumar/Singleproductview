      <p>Product Title and Description: A clear and concise title that accurately represents the product, followed by a detailed description highlighting its features, specifications, and unique selling points.

      Product Images and Videos: High-quality images and videos showcasing the product from different angles and perspectives. This helps customers visualize and understand the product better.
      
      Pricing and Availability: The current price of the product, along with information on its availability (in stock, out of stock, or backorder).
      
      Shipping and Delivery Details: Estimated shipping costs, delivery timeframes, and any applicable shipping restrictions or policies.
      
      Return and Refund Policy: Clearly outline the store's return and refund policy, including conditions, timeframes, and procedures for returning or exchanging products</p><br/><br/>
      <p>Once a potential customer clicks to add something to their cart, this is the page where customer information is collected. Shipping address, billing information, contact information and payment details will be acquired here. Additionally, a business owner may wish to allow for coupon codes and referrals. The Shopify platform makes it incredibly easy to design a shopping cart page with everything you need. If a shopping cart page is not designed well, a confused customer might abandon the checkout process altogether.</p><br/><br/>
      <p>Although product pages may also include this, many smart brands have a section of their website dedicated to the business as a whole and customers' overall satisfaction with the products and services that it offers.</p><br/><br/>
