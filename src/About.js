      <p>Build trust
      The first point of any transaction is trust. It is a certain degree of trust that allows the average user to let their guard down, and trust a brand they have never experienced before.
      
      So when a user is on your about us eCommerce page, they are trying to deepen the trust factor. They are trying to validate and cross-check and absorb more information - so that if they do buy from you, they would be very clear about why they have done so. 
      
      To-do to build trust:
      
      Be transparent about the beginnings of the company, the current locations and the people who founded or are running it. You may also want to clearly bring out the timeline of your brand’s journey. 
      Create stickiness
      Imagine a shopper landing on your website through a broad search query. They may be aware of what they are looking for, but they may not be sure you can provide that. 
      
      This is when they would want to read more about why you exist and what you actually do to bring your offerings to life. (We would consider this to be a good thing because most users drop off at the slightest hint of uncertainty.)
      
      To-do to create stickiness:
      
      Build an authentic narrative that explores a problem statement and then goes on to talk about how the brand is helping solve that problem.</p><br/> <br/> <br/> 
     <p>There is a compelling reason your brand exists. It’s possible that other brands exist for a similar reason, but when you articulate your brand’s USP in clearly differentiated language, customers get a better understanding.

      Without a unique selling point or USP, a brand has no backbone of its own. With a USP, a brand becomes instantly more recognizable and worthy of recall.
      
      Having your USP feature in your about us eCommerce page can offer shoppers a compelling reason to explore your products and even buy! 
      
      Here’s a look at how Pact establishes their USP in a single sentence (even using their trademarked phrase to create more impact). </p><br/> <br/> <br/> 
      <p>Along with what the brand stands for and what it ensures in its products, the about us eCommerce page needs to mention the culture behind a company or brand.

      Quite literally, the culture is the spirit with which a brand comes into existence, living by its values and working towards its vision. A stable and inclusive culture, for example, can instantly increase a shopper’s confidence in a brand. 
      
      Here’s how Planet Fitness sets the tone for their culture to be understood by users in their about us section. The use of phrases like “the judgment free zone” (which also happens to be their trademarked catchline) and “support of our friendly, knowledgeable staff anytime you need it” help to drive home the point.
